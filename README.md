## About  
Managing extensive and large stock analysis reports can be challenging. This website serves as a personal portfolio, allowing you to conveniently store and organize your reports in one place. By sharing the link to your website, potential employers or colleagues can easily access, view, and download your analysis reports.  
## How it works  
All you have to do is  
1) Rename the pdf in the format: `Company - Date.pdf`, where Date has the format `DD_MM_YYYY`
2) Save the PDF in the `pdf` folder
3) Navigate to `main.js` and update it with the name of the newly added PDF file, following the guidance provided in the comments.
  
The PDFs are automatically sorted such that the 5 most recent reports are displayed on the `Home Page`. The remaining reports are organized in the same order and shown with pagination on the `All Analysis` page.
